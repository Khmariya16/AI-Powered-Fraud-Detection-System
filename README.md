# AI-Powered-Fraud-Detection-System


Detect anomalies in financial transactions using machine learning models like Isolation Forest and Autoencoders. Designed to simulate real-world fraud detection scenarios relevant to auditing and consulting domains (e.g., KPMG).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements unsupervised learning techniques to identify fraudulent activities in transactional data without labeled training samples. The system combines traditional machine learning with deep learning-based Autoencoders for anomaly detection.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Anomaly detection using **Isolation Forest**
- ✅ Deep learning-based **Autoencoder model**
- ✅ End-to-end **data preprocessing pipeline**
- ✅ Model evaluation using **confusion matrix**, **classification report**
- ✅ Visual analytics with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Isolation Forest**: Efficient for high-dimensional data, detects outliers based on isolation paths.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural network-based approach that learns to reconstruct normal transactions; anomalies are detected via high reconstruction error.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data processing
- **scikit-learn** for Isolation Forest
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for Autoencoders
- **matplotlib, seaborn** for EDA & visualization
